# Web Developer Senior Assessment Task

## Task Details

This is a responsive webpage created as part of the Web Developer Senior Assessment Task. The task involves building a webpage using HTML, advanced CSS, and JavaScript exclusively. The webpage includes sections for navigation, hero content, about me, contact form, and dynamically generated project information using Liquid templating.

### Task 1 - Advanced Web Development

#### Part A: Build a Responsive Webpage

1. The navigation bar at the top of the page contains links to Home, About, and Contact sections. The logo is displayed to the left.

2. The hero section displays a prominent heading, subheading, and a background image.

3. The About Me section provides a brief description of myself, along with a "Read More" button to expand the description using JavaScript.

4. The Contact section includes a form with fields for Name, Email, and Message.

#### Part B: Dynamic Content Generation

1. The projects section is dynamically generated using Liquid templating. Project information is read from a JSON file and displayed with the project name, truncated description, and a link to the GitHub repository.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the webpage.

3. Navigation: Use the navigation bar to navigate to different sections of the webpage.

4. About Me: Click the "Read More..." button in the About section to expand the description.

5. Contact: Fill out the form in the Contact section with your name, email, and message, then click the "Send Message" button.

6. Projects: The projects section is dynamically generated based on the data in the `projects.json` file. Each project displays its name, truncated description, and a link to the GitHub repository.
